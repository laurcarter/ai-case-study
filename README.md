* **When was the company incorporated?** 
  - 2014

* **Who are the founders of the company?**

This led him to found Behavox in 2014, with the aim of using AI to aggregate, analyze, and act on communication data across various channels, such as emails, phone calls, and chat messages. 
  > "The way people work today is highly digital—we send emails, we’re on the phone, we’re on Uber chat—and that is amplified in financial services, where we no longer go to restaurants to trade stocks, and we certainly don’t write them up on tickets. Everything is electronic, which means the workplace is no longer a place—it’s a digital domain. The way we run companies, the way we motivate people, the way we analyze our people, the way we do everything has to be completely changed, because when it’s digital it means that you can analyze it using computers. And if you can analyze it using computers, artificial intelligence is able to do all of these amazing things."
